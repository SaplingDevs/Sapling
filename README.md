## What is Sapling?

Sapling is a Minecraft Bedrock __Technical__ addon, similar to Carpet Mod in Java Edition. Sapling opens up a world of possibilities with its features!

## What is Sapling's philosophy?

Sapling aims to be an addon where you are free to use what you want and what you don't. That's why __all features__ are toggleable, allowing you to choose which ones to activate for your gaming experience.
